                    <p class="description MiChe-description">
                        "Hey, you know I love complaining about something as much as the next person -- and believe me I sure did for the first 18 years my life -- but you never really know how good you have it until it gets ripped from your hands.
                        And by 'ripped from your hands' I mean you get an acceptance letter to your dream univeristy and it only then settles that you have to move out.
                        <br><br>
                        Everything that I was accustomed to, poof, bye bye. 
                        <br><br>
                        I got used to a lot of things. I got used 15 minute travels times. I got used to getting driven everywhere. I got used to seeing the same people. I got used to going to the same places. 
                        I got used to my free time. I got used to my busy time. I got used to my mom's cooking. I got used to my mom's scolding. To be frank, I got used to Windsor.
                        <br><br>
                        But now I gotta Waterloo. Eventhough they start with the same letter, 'W', I found that did not help in trying to get used to things. I have to get used to walking everywhere since I don't have a car.
                        I have to get used to buying my own groceries and cooking my own food. I have to get used to going to places alone because sometimes no one else wants to study in the basement of RCH with you (I'm not sure why, it's a lovely place).
                        And I have to get used knowing my way around.
                        <br><br>
                        It's all quite frustrating to be honest. I've spent my whole life trying to learn my way around Windsor, memorizing street names and learning key locations only to have to
                        start all over again. And based on how easily I get lost in Waterloo, I don't think my navigation-learning skills have improved by that much.
                        <br><br>
                        But alas I perservere. 
                        <br><br>
                        ...
                        <br><br>
                        Oh right, the painting. 
                        <br><br>
                        I guess I'm trying to say that it's a dedication to my hometown and was a way to express my love for it and how much I miss it blah blah blah. But that's a little to sentimental for my tastes. 
                        So I rant instead because that's what I'm good at (Unless you are an employer, to whom I am exceptionally skilled at getting straight to the point. Rant? Me? Never.)"

                        "Ah yes, Colour Vision. An oldie but a goodie.
                        <br><br>
                        You know how there are gateway drugs? Drugs that kinda give you the habit of taking drugs? Well this piece was my gateway drug. Not that I took drugs to make it, God no.
                        More like metaphorically, in the sense that this piece helped me develop my current painting style. I really should stop callling it a gateway drug. Ok, scratch that out.
                        This piece is my <b>gateway painting</b>. That's better.
                        <br><br>
                        It all started one day when I felt ambitious, I mean realllllly amibitious. I wanted to try tackling one of the hyperrealistic paintings - the paintings that look like photos, thats how detailed they are.
                        So, I found a reference photo of a pink flower and went to work. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now, when people ask me to describe myself, dedicated and hardworking are words I use. I use them because it's true. When I want to get something done, I will break my own bones if that means I can get to it.
                        Where am I going with this? When I tell you I spent 10 hours on this piece without a break trying to achieve hyperrealism on a single petal I am NOT lying. I speak only the truth.
                        And the aching I felt in my spine the next day will also attest to this.
                        <br><br>
                        Did you know flowers have like vein things? They're so tiny and barely noticable but also extremely noticiable if they're not there. I could not, for the life of me -- and I probably still can't now -- draw those darn veins.
                        <br><br>
                        So I gave up.
                        <br><br>
                        But before you call me a hypocrite, 'Oh but you just said you're sooooooo hardworking, what happended to breaking you're bones to succeed,' let me explain. You see, if you're thinking that, you've falling in my loophole. Go back and read that sentence.
                        'When I want to get something done, I will break my own bones if that means I can get to it.' Notice the <i>'want'</i> part. My dedication truely is unbreakable, but my boredom is not.
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to swerve off the metaphorical road that I built for myself and decided to drive towards a flower field, a really colourful one. During my non-stop painful petal painting session, I worked with a lot of colours. Now maybe this was the exhaution speaking, but I begain noticing
                        how some colours with darker than others. 'This blue is quite shadow-like,' and 'This yellow is quite highlight-like.' Thus, I began to experiment. Half-way through I found a bottle of gold painting in the basement and thought 'Why not?' and threw it in there as well.
                        <br><br>
                        And boom. Colour Vision, at your service.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this piece I learned the value of my passion and my time. I also learned to experiment, and embrace spontaneity because sometimes, the spontaneous path ends up way more fun than the planned one."

                    <p class="description MiChe-description">
                        "Sometimes people ask me why I don't paint on more sophisticated or more permenant materials like a canvas or solid board. My answer was always that I never had one on hand. I don't prepare for my bursts of creativity. 
                        I can't really plan for them. So, that's why I use what's at hand - cardboard, paper, wood from the garage, etc. I'm <i>resourceful</i>.
                        <br><br>
                        The story for this one, not as fun. So, I'm not going to tell it. I'll rant a little more until the description for this piece is similar in length to the other ones. Maybe one day I'll come back and change, who knows, I sure don't. 
                        <br><br>
                        Maybe this is a good place to give a quick tutorial as to how I paint my iconic style. Yeah, that's what I'll do.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>STEP 1: It's all about that base.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Whatever you knew about colours, throw it away. The flowers I paint are predominantly red, so what colour should the base be? Blue obviously.
                        No, I'm serious, a dark blue base. I'm not really sure why, but I like to think that it creates the shadow of the object before the object actually exists. 
                        Geometry-wise, the base is a literal blob. Detailed shapes are overrated. I don't even bother with petals, that a different colour's problem.
                        <br><br>
                        Flowers also have stems and leaves which due to the chlorophyl content in their chemical makeup - are green. So, our base will be bright red. Using a base of red or orange really brings out some of the warmer tones of the flower.
                        Makes the whole scene look more alive, which is important since they're flowers. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Now, take a step back and take a good look at your progress!
                        <br><br>
                        ...Ok, maybe there's some more work to be done.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>STEP 2: More reasonable colours</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Fine, I'll admit it, I was gaslighting you for a bit. Red flowers aren't actually blue and green leaves aren't red. So let's just cover those up. Maybe leave a slight outine for that <i>artistic vibe</i>.
                        This is where those thick layers of paint come in. So, take your time, be patient. This is also where the shapes of petals and leaves come in, so come on, chop chop.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>STEP 3: Highlights and Lowlights (are lowlights a thing? I'm not sure)</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Now, a good rule I use when I make most of my pieces is never use black or white. Whenever I use those it just dulls out the bright colours I strive so hard to capture. If I ever do use them, it's to mix them with other colors to widen my hue range.
                        So, use some of the yellows and oranges for your highlights (and some pink if you're feeling fruity today). Build more on shadows with those blues and purples.
